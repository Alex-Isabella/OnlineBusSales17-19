Cleaning/Analyzing/Reporting Data from an online ecommerce store downloaded from Kaggle

Clean It Up

Table Name; Product_Sales
Column Names; Product Type, Net Quantity, Gross Sales, Discounts, Returns, Total Net Sales

The first thing I Had to do was rename all the columns and replace the " " with "_"

ALTER TABLE Product_Sales RENAME COLUMN 'Product Type' TO 'Product_Type'

Refresh the database and do a simple check

SELECT *
   FROM Product_Sales
   
Everything looks good time for the other columns

ALTER TABLE Product_Sales RENAME COLUMN 'Net Quantity' TO 'Net_Quantity';
ALTER TABLE Product_Sales RENAME COLUMN 'Gross Sales' TO 'Gross_Sales';
ALTER TABLE Product_Sales RENAME COLUMN 'Gross Sales' TO 'Total_Net_Sales';

Analyze

Now we can start with some real analysis
