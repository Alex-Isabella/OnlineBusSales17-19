Similar to the Product Data I have to do a little data cleaning

Change all column names that need to replace " " with "_"

ALTER TABLE Sales_Data RENAME COLUMN 'Total Orders' TO 'Total_Orders'
ALTER TABLE Sales_Data RENAME COLUMN 'Gross Sales' TO 'Gross_Sales';
ALTER TABLE Sales_Data RENAME COLUMN 'Net Sales' TO 'Net_Sales';
ALTER TABLE Sales_Data RENAME COLUMN 'Total Sales' TO 'Total_Sales';
